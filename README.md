Please use google colab pro for running this code, the size of the ram required is more than 12 Gigabytes

This report contains two parts. At the first part, I have completely explained the logic and mathematical intuition behind the code (Page 1 to 10). While at the second part (Page 11 to 19), the python code implementation is fully explained. The code is written from the scratch.
